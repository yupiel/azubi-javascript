Azubi-javascript
================

this is the missing repo to teach the core concepts about javascript

usage
---------

The idea is to have failing tests and the azubis have to fix them.

    npm install # once
    npm run all # to run the whole test suite
    npm run single -- <folder> # to run one specific suite


1. Datatypes
-------------

- what datatypes do exist in the programming language JavaScript?  List them!
- what does coersion mean? Give me an example!

Now solve the test suite by fixing all the tests:

```npm run single -- datatypes```

2. Control structures
---------------------

- what control structures do you know?
- given a loop that prints number from 1 to 5. Implement this with a for loop and a while loop.
- What is a fall-through in context of a switch statement?

Now solve the test suite by fixing all the tests:

```npm run single -- controlstructures```

3. Arrays
---------------------

- what operations would you do with a list of elements? List them!
- why do you think is this true ```typeof [] ==  "object"```? What makes an object an object in classical programming?

Now solve the test suite by fixing all the tests:

```npm run single -- arrays```
